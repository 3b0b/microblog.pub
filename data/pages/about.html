    <p>
      I am a software developer, gamer, occasional disc golfer, and general nuisance in the southeastern United States of America. I like puns, dogs, the ways in which other people like cats, food that is bad for me, science fiction and fantasy literature, thinking of silly questions and not bothering to try to figure out the answers.

      It is my intent to expand on this eventually, but for the moment I really kind of just want to create my About and License pages as a demonstration to myself that the way I have set them up works as intended.
