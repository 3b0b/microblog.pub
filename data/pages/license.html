      tl;dr: At least as I currently believe that license to apply, it means you can read my content on your instance, boost/share/retoot or whatever your instance calls it - or do the equivalent in Indieweb context - including adaptation and remixing, as long as it isn't for commercial purposes and you credit me and share your adaptations under the same terms.

      We'll see how that goes. If you want to inquire about using any of my content for commercial purposes, be sure to mention that subject and the specific content in question when contacting me.

      I picked this license after having thought about the question several times, frequently in context of seeing posts related to Fediverse search and similar topics in which people sometimes seemed to be thinking about their content in ways that struck me as either inadequately deliberate or incompatible with content federation, and then finally getting around to reading the Creative Commons site for about an hour. I think it's the best readily-available fit, although I'm still pondering how ideal a fit that is. Since CC licensing is not revocable, I tried to be careful about not starting with a more permissive license than I intended.

      BY (Attribution), I think, is both reasonable and mostly compatible with the Fediverse, with one possible catch. CC 4.0 explicitly says that the attribution conditions may be satisfied "in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information." It seems to me that means it should be considered satisfied by the fact that from any federated display of my content, it should be possible to get back to the permalink on my instance, where the license appears in the site header. However, while I can't find it again at the moment, I believe I saw somewhere on the Creative Commons site that seemed to suggest that the <em>link to the CC license itself</em> is required to be included directly. The actual license text doesn't appear to me to support that distinction.

      NC (NonCommercial) is relatively straightforward. I'm not, by default, extending a license for anyone else to use my content to make money.

      SA (ShareAlike) is...interesting, at least to me. I'm still trying to wrap my head around what should and shouldn't be considered a derivative work. I'm pretty sure replying to me, or writing your own article and referring to one of mine, shouldn't be, except in the unlikely event of taking a concept I posted about and posting your own riff entirely inspired by it. If you're concerned about it, and licensing what you want to write CC-BY-NC-SA is a problem for you, then I appreciate the concern and respect, and I'll ask that you take the same approach as if you want to use my content for commercial purposes, and contact me to discuss it. I am inclined to think that in most cases, it is unlikely that someone would create a derivative work without coming across what license I used. The question I find particularly interesting, though, is...the ShareAlike clause also says that satisfying the condition of including "the text of, or...link to, the...License You apply" may be done in any reasonable manner based on medium, means, and context. So if someone did create a derivative work, and they did not specify some other incompatible license but they did link to my original content in attribution, does that mean their derivative work is <em>implicitly</em> CC-BY-NC-SA because of my license?

      I don't know. It probably won't come up.
