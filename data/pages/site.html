<h1>About This Site</h1>

    <p>
      As indicated in the footer, my blog is using microblog.pub, a single-user, ActivityPub-powered microblog. I have made some customizations, some of which I intend to contribute upstream eventually if upstream wants them. At the time of this update, I have added a <a href="https://github.com/3b0b/microblog.pub/commits/custom/current">branch</a> on my fork that I can try to remember to keep set up so that it can be used to find all my customized functionality. For example, at the moment, that branch includes the creation of my first custom pages and the handler for them, but not subsequent content updates (such as updating this page).

      My Indieweb wiki <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Bw3.dev" rel="me">user</a> page will likely continue to have some information about how I use the software for as long as I continue to do so, although it may sometimes lag behind reality.

      Below is a collection of links to posts I've made that are partly or wholly about the site itself. Starting in 2024, I have decided that future <a href="/articles">articles</a> about the site will either be listed with "State of the Blog" in the title <em>or</em> eventually be added to this list, and future notes will be tagged so that they should appear under the last link.

      If you have questions or suggestions about my site, as opposed to either microblog.pub in general or a specific note or article, the best place to bring those is probably either on Github or by sending me a direct message or possibly a webmention. (It occurs to me that I'm not actually sure how well microblogpub currently handles webmentions of just the site, not a specific post, let alone of custom routes...) One of the methods of contacting me you can find in my profile may be an appropriate alternative, but please be clear about the subject from the outset. Greetings without immediate topics have a high overlap with conversations I don't want to have, and I usually treat them as spam.
