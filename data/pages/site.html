      As indicated in the footer, my blog is using microblog.pub, a single-user, ActivityPub-powered microblog. My fork, including some customizations (some of which I intend to contribute upstream), is on <a href="https://github.com/3b0b/microblog.pub/tree/mine">Github</a>.

      I expect to have more to say about that later, but there is some historical and (as of this writing) partly outdated information about it in my articles, post history, and Indieweb wiki <a href="https://indieweb.org/User:Bw3.dev" rel="me">user</a> page.
